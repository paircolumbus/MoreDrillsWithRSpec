#This script is different than FizzBuzz. It should accept user input from the terminal if done correctly. Run it to see what it does then complete the speak method so that it returns & prints the correct thing.

#CAREFUL! This script will not exit. Do you know why? You may have to close it with `Ctrl-C` (Mac) if you do not insert an `exit` into your speak method.
